# CHALLENGE-ii
**My second git repo**
This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

**The Challenge:** View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

**Process**

Built with

- VScode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flex

**What I learned**
Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly.
Some of the CSS properties were:
 
- how and when to using positioning
- more knowledge on divs, their height and width
